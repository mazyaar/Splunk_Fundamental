## 1. What is Splunk?
Splunk is a powerful platform for searching, analyzing, and visualizing machine-generated data gathered from websites, applications, sensors, devices, etc., which make up the IT infrastructure and business. Splunk provides insights from machine data and is able to generate graphs, alerts, and dashboards.

## 2. What are the components of Splunk?

## 5. How does Splunk handle data indexing?
Splunk processes data in three stages: input, parsing, and indexing. The data is first collected, then parsed into events, and finally indexed for fast searching.

## 6. What is a Splunk Forwarder?
A forwarder collects logs and sends them to the Splunk indexer. There are two types:
- **Universal Forwarder (UF):** Lightweight, only forwards data.
- **Heavy Forwarder (HF):** Full Splunk instance, can parse data before forwarding.

## 7. What are Splunk buckets?
Buckets are directories containing indexed data. Buckets are created during the data indexing process and contain both raw data and indexed data.

- **Search Factor (SF):** Number of searchable copies of data.
- **Replication Factor (RF):** Number of copies of data maintained by Splunk.

## 14. What is a Splunk Cluster?
A cluster in Splunk is a group of instances working together. There are two types of clusters:
- **Indexer Cluster:** Provides high availability and disaster recovery.
- **Search Head Cluster:** Manages search load by distributing searches across multiple search heads.

## 15. How do you monitor real-time data in Splunk?
Real-time data monitoring in Splunk can be done using live dashboards and real-time searches that update dynamically as new data is indexed.

## 16. What is a Splunk deployment server?
A deployment server manages and deploys configurations and apps to multiple Splunk instances, typically forwarders.

## 17. What is the function of the _internal index in Splunk?
The _internal index stores Splunk’s internal logs and metrics data, useful for monitoring Splunk's health and performance.

## 18. How do you create a scheduled report in Splunk?
Scheduled reports can be created by saving a search query and configuring it to run at specified intervals. Results can be delivered via email or stored in a report.

## 19. What is a Splunk summary index?
A summary index stores the results of scheduled searches, which helps in improving search performance and reducing the load on the primary index.

## 20. How can you optimize Splunk searches?
- **Use selective fields.**
- **Filter data as early as possible.**
- **Leverage summary indexing and event sampling.**

## 21. What is the use of eval command in Splunk?
The `eval` command is used to evaluate expressions, perform calculations, and manipulate field values in Splunk search queries.

## 22. Explain the difference between stats and eventstats in Splunk.
- **stats:** Generates summary statistics of data.
- **eventstats:** Similar to stats but appends the results to each event.

## 23. How do you handle duplicate events in Splunk?
Duplicate events can be managed by using the `dedup` command, which removes duplicate events based on specified fields.

## 24. What are Splunk lookup tables?
Lookup tables are external files or KV stores that can be used to add more context to Splunk data, enhancing search results and enriching events.

## 25. What is the use of Splunk's rename command?
The `rename` command is used to change the names of fields in search results for better readability or to avoid conflicts.

## 26. What is the use of the `timechart` command in Splunk?
The `timechart` command is used to create time-based visualizations, aggregating data over specified time intervals.

## 27. How can you integrate Splunk with Hadoop?
Splunk can be integrated with Hadoop using the Splunk Hadoop Connect app, allowing data to be exported to or imported from Hadoop.

## 28. What is a Splunk data model?
A data model is a structured hierarchy of datasets that represent domain-specific knowledge and can be used to create Pivot reports.

## 29. How can you restrict user access in Splunk?
User access can be restricted by defining roles and assigning appropriate capabilities and indexes to those roles.

## 30. What is the difference between Splunk SDK and Splunk REST API?
- **Splunk SDK:** Provides libraries to interact with Splunk in different programming languages.
- **Splunk REST API:** Offers REST endpoints to interact with Splunk for searching, data input, and more.

## 31. What is a Splunk macro?
A macro is a reusable search query or a search query fragment that can be used in multiple searches to avoid redundancy.

## 32. How do you create alerts in Splunk?
Alerts are created by saving a search and configuring alert conditions, such as thresholds, and defining actions to be taken when conditions are met.

## 33. What is the use of the `rex` command in Splunk?
The `rex` command is used for extracting fields using regular expressions and for field transformation.

## 34. Explain the role of the license master in Splunk.
The license master manages Splunk license usage, ensuring that the indexing volume does not exceed the licensed capacity.

## 35. What is a Splunk workflow action?
Workflow actions allow users to define actions such as GET, POST, and search requests based on field values in search results.

## 36. How do you set up forwarding in Splunk?
Forwarding is set up by configuring forwarders to send data to indexers, specifying the target indexer’s IP and port.

## 37. What is a Splunk pivot?
A pivot is a visual representation of data models, allowing users to create reports and dashboards without writing SPL queries.

## 38. What is the difference between inputlookup and outputlookup in Splunk?

## 41. What is the role of the `collect` command in Splunk?
The `collect` command is used to write search results to a summary index or another specified index for further analysis.

## 42. How can you automate Splunk administration tasks?
Automation can be achieved using scripts, the Splunk REST API, or the Splunk CLI to perform repetitive tasks.
